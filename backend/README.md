# Project Name - Backend

## How to Run the Backend

To run the backend server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "backend" directory using the terminal or command prompt.
   
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Once inside the "backend" directory, start the server by typing the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   This will launch the backend server, and you should see relevant output or logs indicating that the server is running.

3. Access the backend services and APIs as needed.

   - If applicable, open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:your-port](http://localhost:your-port) (replace "your-port" with the actual port number if it's different). This for testing the application through the UI
   - Otherwise you can use postman to test the API endpoints

4. To stop the server, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running.

Feel free to contact the development team or refer to additional documentation for more details about the backend functionalities.

Happy coding!
